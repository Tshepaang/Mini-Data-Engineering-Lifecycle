# E-commerce Data Engineering Lifecycle Prototype

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **small-scale data engineering lifecycle** using an e-commerce product recommendation scenario.  
It simulates how raw purchase data flows through ingestion, transformation, and serving layers to produce insights.

The prototype aligns with core data engineering concepts such as:
- ETL / ELT pipelines
- Data transformation
- Analytical data serving
- Monitoring and reporting

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

1. **Data Generation**
   - Simulated customer purchase data

2. **Data Storage**
   - CSV file acting as raw data storage

3. **Data Ingestion**
   - Data loaded into Python using Pandas

4. **Data Transformation**
   - Cleaning and grouping purchase data by user

5. **Data Serving**
   - Simple product recommendation logic

6. **Monitoring**
   - Record counts and pipeline success indicators
